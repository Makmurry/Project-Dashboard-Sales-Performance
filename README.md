# Project-Dashboard-Sales-Performance


Superstore is one branch of the Primestore company, which is currently facing difficulties in understanding sales performance and identifying areas that need improvement. Therefore, the need for this dashboard is crucial to facilitate store managers in making informed decisions. Consequently, the management has assigned the task to the Business Analyst team to plan and implement a project that can address this issue.

This project aims to analyze and discover insights about Profit, Sales, Products, and Customers based on Superstore sales data from the period of 2014-2017, and then present the results on a dashboard.
